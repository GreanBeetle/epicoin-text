What is a blockchain?

History
Cypherpunks. 80s and 90s
i. Cypherpunks were a loose-knit, international collection of activists in the eighties and nineties. They believed in cryptography and protective, privacy-enhancing technology as a means to political and social change.
ii. They deeply mistrusted centralized authority of any sort and thought privacy necessary for a free and open society in the digital age. Governments, corporations, and other large entities, they thought, could not be trusted to grant us privacy.
iii. Regarding code, the Cypherpunks believed someone had to write the software to defend this privacy, and said they were the folks who would do that.
iv. So, their goal? To build a community free from the state and centralized authority. To do that, they needed digital money.
v. They wanted to replace money.

Problems with Digital Money
i. Authentication. Any person can control any other personâ€™s account.
ii. Reliability and Availability. If digital currency is stored on a central server and the server goes down, the money is lost. If a government shuts down the server, the currency dies.
iii. Security. A central server is vulnerable to hacking. Bad actors and malicious parties might steal the cryptocurrency.

Answer to Problems with Digital Money
i. Decentralization. Kill the server.
ii. This leads to peer-to-peer networks. I.e. information and data are distributed among a network of people and their computers. The act of sharing, distributing and storing data and information on a peer-to-peer network is called gossip.

Decentralization and Gossip Protocols
i. Gossip protocols are the processes and procedures used to share information on a peer-to-peer network.
ii. A gossip protocol is leaderless. Everyone in the protocol is equal, replaceable.
iii. Every person in the network connects to every other person to learn about the state of the network.
iv. To send a transaction, we gossip to our peers and allow the transaction to propagate through the network, which can take time.
v. There are problems with this!
vi. A bad actor can do something random and screw up the information being shared. Or do something intentionally malicious, e.g. lie, say the sender was giving them money when in fact the sender intended the money go elsewhere.
vii. This is no good in a monetary system.

Answer to Problems with Gossip Protocols.
i. Cryptography.
ii. More specifically, public-key cryptography. Public-key generates two keys for each person, one public and one private. You might think of this as a username and password. These become your identity on the peer-to-peer network.
iii. At this point we can encrypt our messages.
iv. But there is still a problem called
