What is a blockchain?

A chain of digital records. Each record is called a block, because it is a block of code. Each block is chained to both the previous and following block by a unique identifier known as a hash. A hash is a sequence of letters and numbers generated by solving a cryptographic puzzle. The process of solving these cryptographic puzzles is known as mining. Every time a puzzle is solved, a new hash and thereby new block is created.

History
Cypherpunks. 80s and 90s
i. Cypherpunks were a loose-knit, international collection of activists in the eighties and nineties. They believed in cryptography and protective, privacy-enhancing technology as a means to political and social change.
ii. They deeply mistrusted centralized authority of any sort and thought privacy necessary for a free and open society in the digital age. Governments, corporations, and other large entities, they thought, could not be trusted to grant us privacy.
iii. Regarding code, the Cypherpunks believed someone had to write the software to defend this privacy, and said they were the folks who would do that.
iv. So, their goal? To build a community free from the state and centralized authority. To do that, they needed digital money.
v. They wanted to replace money.

Problems with Digital Money
i. Authentication. Any person can control any other person’s account.
ii. Reliability and Availability. If digital currency is stored on a central server and the server goes down, the money is lost. If a government shuts down the server, the currency dies.
iii. Security. A central server is vulnerable to hacking. Bad actors and malicious parties might steal the cryptocurrency.

Answer to Problems with Digital Money
i. Decentralization. Kill the server.
ii. This leads to peer-to-peer networks. I.e. information and data are distributed among a network of people and their computers. The act of sharing, distributing and storing data and information on a peer-to-peer network is called gossip.

Decentralization and Gossip Protocols
i. Gossip protocols are the processes and procedures used to share information on a peer-to-peer network.
ii. A gossip protocol is leaderless. Everyone in the protocol is equal, replaceable.
iii. Every person in the network connects to every other person to learn about the state of the network.
iv. To send a transaction, we gossip to our peers and allow the transaction to propagate through the network, which can take time.
v. There are problems with this!
vi. A bad actor can do something random and screw up the information being shared. Or do something intentionally malicious, e.g. lie, say the sender was giving them money when in fact the sender intended the money go elsewhere.
vii. This is no good in a monetary system.

Answer to Problems with Gossip Protocols
i. Cryptography.
ii. More specifically, public-key cryptography. Public-key generates two keys for each person, one public and one private. You might think of this as a username and password. These become your identity on the peer-to-peer network.
iii. At this point we can encrypt our messages.
iv. There is still problem with this. It is called the Double Spend.
v. The double spend problem is when someone sends the same information to different people. For example, Sophie has 10 epicoin. In simultaneous transactions, she then grants two (or many) different people ownership of her 10 epicoin. In a gossip protocol, where information is slowly shared over a network, how is the network to know which transaction is true?

Cypherpunk Answer to Double Spend Problem
i. The Blockchain! E.g. a chain of digital records wherein each record (known as a block) is linked to both the previous and following records by something called a hash.
ii. The progenitor of this idea is a person or group of people who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2008, Nakamoto published a white paper (a report, governmental or otherwise authoritative, proposing ideas about an issue) detailing both the philosophy behind and practical implementation of blockchains. E.g., the paper described protocol for a new, decentralized digital currency.
iii. Satoshi Nakamoto went on to found Bitcoin. Depending on your source (e.g. wikipedia, TIME Magazine, etc.), Nakamoto’s true identity may or may not be known. Some sources claim the NSA identified him using stylometry (the study of linguistic style). Others say that his identity remains a mystery.  Whoever he is, he is said to be the world’s most reclusive billionaire, currently valued around $7 billion.
iv. The biggest problem addressed by the white paper is the double-spend.



Terms

Blockchain. A chain of digital records. Each record in the chain is chronologically linked to both the previous and following record. These records are referred to as blocks, ergo, blockchain. by a unique identifier known as a hash.
Client.
Cryptocurrency. Encrypted, digital currency.
Cryptography. The study and practice of techniques granting secure communication between people.
Fiat. Fiat currency.
Genesis block.
Gossip. Gossip protocol. The process of computer to computer communication among peer-to-peer networks.
Hash.
Mining.
Node. Intersection point. I.e. the point at which lines or paths connect, converge, or diverge. In computer terminology, a node is a device (e.g. your phone or laptop) or even data point within a larger network.
